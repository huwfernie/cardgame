# cardgame


This is a game of Poker, sort of.

You can choose the number of players, and the number of cards each player will be dealt.

Press the "Go" button and see what cards you get; whoever has the highest hand wins.

The Tech:

Well it's a JavaScript game with a bit of help from jQuery, which is pulled in from a CDN so you need to be online to load the game properly.

If you download by forking the GitHub repo or by unzipping the compressed folder all the files and folders should be in the right place and ready to go:

Open the index.html file in your normal web browser and you should be ready to play.
