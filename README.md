# Card Game


This is a game of Poker, sort of.

You can choose the number of players, and the number of cards each player will be dealt.

Press the `"Start"` button and see what cards you get; whoever has the highest hand wins.

Each card is worth it's face value: 13pts for a king, 1 for an ace.

- There are 40 bonus points for a straight (like 5,4,3,2,1)
- 20 bonus points for three of a kind
- 10 bonus points for a pair

### The Tech:

If you download by forking the GitHub repo or by unzipping the compressed folder all the files and folders should be in the right place and ready to go:
